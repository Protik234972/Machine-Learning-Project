# Projects

# Diabetes Prediction using SVM
   
Objective: Develop a predictive model to classify whether a patient has diabetes based on specific health parameters.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and normalizing patient health data.

Model Training: Implementing SVM for classification.

Evaluation: Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.


# Rock and Mine Detection using Logistic Regression

Objective: Create a model to distinguish between rocks and mines based on sonar signal data.

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values and scaling features.

Model Training: Implementing Logistic Regression for binary classification.

Evaluation: Analyzing the modelâ€™s performance using confusion matrix, accuracy, and AUC-ROC.

Dataset: The dataset consists of sonar signals data, where each sample represents a set of frequency readings that can be used to classify the object as a rock or mine.
